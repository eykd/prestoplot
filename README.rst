PrestoPlot
==========

Boom! Instant plot!

PrestoPlot is a tool for idea generation, name generation, and other tomfoolery
when you should otherwise be writing.

Goes best with the oracles from the `PrestoPlot Oracles` repository.

About
-----

I wrote PrestoPlot to support idea generation and name generation for my new
science fiction space opera series, `Salvage of Empire`_.

The main feature right now is a generative grammar that uses a simple YAML-based
language and `Python f-string syntax` to create "oracles" for idea generation.
